The jsonSchemas folder is automatically filled with the json schemas generated from the POJOs which in turn are generated from the xsd files.

The jsonExamples folder contains some json examples validated against the associated schemas in the jsonSchemas folder.

The alternativeSolution folder contains the non-terminated schemas and examples manually generated from XSD files in order to generate the exactly same POJOs generated by JAXB. This process has been abandoned thanks to the automatic generation provided by the plugin.
