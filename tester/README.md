In order to run the automatic testing script test.py, you need the following dependencies installed on your python distribution:
- "requests" python package -> http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
- "jsonschema" python package -> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema

IMPORTANT - If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your machine, check carefully that the version you are actually using when running the script, has the required packages installed. Requested version is Python 3+

HINT - to install a package you can raise the following command (Bash on Linux or DOS shell on Windows):
	python -m pip install jsonschema
	python -m pip install requests
